Human-friendly structured data (HSD)
====================================

The human-friendly structured data is a configuration markup language with a
light easy to read and easy to type syntax, making it ideal for config files
which must be created and edited by humans (such as input files for scientific
programs). It allows arbitrary number of nesting levels and can be two-way
mapped onto a subset of XML.

This project provides utilites for parsing such data, building a tree structure
out of it and to query it.

Currently only a Python implementation is available, but other languages should
follow later.
